What WordPress changes WP Activity Log tracks
A website activity log is important for improving troubleshooting, compliance, user management, and security.
Get WP Activity Log and keep track of events on your site. The log not only tells you that a post, a user profile, or an object was updated, it also lets you know exactly what changed, when, and includes a user log (by whom), so you always have the information you need.

Below is a summary of the changes that the plugin can keep a record of:

Post, page, and custom post type changes: Status, content changes, title, URL, custom field, and other metadata changes

Tags and category changes: Creating, modifying, deleting, and adding/removing them from posts

Widget and menu changes: Creating, modifying, or deleting them

User changes: User created or registered, deleted, or added to a site on multisite network

User profile changes: Password, email, display name, and role changes

Access logging: User login, logout, failed logins, and terminating other sessions

WordPress core and settings changes: Installed updates, permalinks, default role, URL, and other site-wide changes

WordPress multisite network changes: Adding, deleting, or archiving sites, adding or removing users from sites, etc.

Plugin and Theme changes: Installing, activating, deactivating, uninstalling, and updating

WordPress database changes: When a plugin adds or removes a table

Third-party plugin changes: WooCommerce Stores & products, Yoast SEO, RankMath, Termly, WPForms, Gravity Forms, Advanced Custom Fields (ACF), MainWP, ManageWP, WP Umbrella, and other popular WordPress plugins

WordPress site file changes: New files added, or existing files modified or deleted.

Event details recorded
Detailed event logging ensures that for every event that the plugin records, it reports the:

Date & time (and milliseconds) of when it happened
User & role of the user who did the change
Source IP address from where the change happened
The object on which the change has taken place
